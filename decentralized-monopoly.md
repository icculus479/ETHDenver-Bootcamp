Team Discussion
---------------

An impromptu team was formed with mdcoxmt (https://github.com/mdcoxmt) and we worked through his proposed idea of an email based process which utilized received timestamps as the random dice rolls and card choices.

Duncan's idea was a great one, and we only came up with a few areas to poke holes in, but for this exercise didn't pursue any further

**What prevents a user from representing multiple players within the same game?**
> - Possible DECO verification could be implemented to privately have users verify their credentials

**If a user is in jail, how do you avoid any disagreement on the number of turns they have tried to get out?**
> - Group would need to agree on a counter being passed through on the subsequent emails

Duncan's idea is outlined on his Gitub here : https://github.com/mdcoxmt/ETHDen-Bootcamp/blob/main/decentralized-monopoly.md
