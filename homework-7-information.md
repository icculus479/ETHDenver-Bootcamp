Adding more functionality to the Volcano Coin contract

### 1.) We made a payment mapping, but we haven始t added all the functionality for it yet. Write a function to view the payment records, specifying the user as an input. What is the difference between doing this and making the mapping public?

### 2.) For the payments record mapping, create a function called recordPayment that takes the sender始s address, the receiver始s address and the amount as an input, then creates a new payment record and adds the new record to the user始s payment record.
>>First we need to add the sender variable to the struct

>>Now we can add the new variable into the mapping

### 3.) Each time we make a transfer of tokens, we should call the this recordPayment function to record the transfer.

### Because we only adjusted the underlying values behind the exising Transfers mapping.  Now when we call the getPayments, we'll receive all 3 variables
